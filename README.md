# 🎬 AI Movie Plot Generator

**🔗 Live Site: [ai-movie-plot-generator.vercel.app](https://ai-movie-plot-generator.vercel.app/)**

An AI-powered movie plot generator. Give it a vague story idea, and it uses Google's Gemini models to figure out what's missing, ask a few smart clarifying questions, and generate a fully structured plot — complete with characters, locations, and a three-act to five-act breakdown — ready to export as a PDF.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Idea → Plot pipeline** — enter a rough concept plus genre/tone, and the AI decides on its own whether it needs more detail before writing.
- **Smart clarifying questions** — the AI only asks about what's genuinely ambiguous (character names, ages, relationships, setting, conflict), capped at 6 questions, and skips straight to plot generation if your idea is already detailed enough.
- **Structured plot generation** — title, genre, logline, a full character roster (name, age, gender, role, arc), key locations, and a three-act structure that weaves in every detail you provided.
- **One-click PDF export** — generates a clean, readable PDF entirely in the browser (via `jsPDF`) and downloads it straight to your device. No server round-trip, no data stored anywhere.
- **Streaming-platform aesthetic** — a dark, synthwave-themed UI built with Tailwind + DaisyUI.

## 🚀 Getting Started (local development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) API key

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-movie-plot-generator.git
cd ai-movie-plot-generator
```

### 2. Backend setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in `backend/.env`:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-flash-latest
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173

Run it:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
Create `frontend/.env`:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

Run it:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` — make sure the backend is running at the same time.

## ☁️ Deployment

- **Backend** is deployed on [Render](https://render.com) (free tier). Note: free-tier services sleep after inactivity — the first request after idle can take 30–60 seconds to respond.
- **Frontend** is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), pulling `VITE_API_URL` from its project environment variables at build time.

---

## 🗺️ Not Included (by design)

- **Persistent storage** — plots aren't saved to a database; each session is stateless.
- **AI poster art** — removed to conserve free-tier Gemini API quota.
